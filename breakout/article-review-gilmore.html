                        Happy Gilmore, Directed by Dennis Dugan, is a 90’s Romantic thriller about an old woman who
                        couldn’t pay her taxes and was forced to work as a slave in an old people’s home where she
                        falls into an abusive and violent relationship with the manager of the care home, and CEO of the
                        quilt knitting sweat shop Hal, played by Ben Stiller. Frances Bay gives an incredibly weak
                        performance as ‘feeble old tax dodger’ throughout the film. However, her character develops as
                        she is abandoned by her grandson Happy [Played by Adam Sandler] who puts her in an old
                        people’s home after she refused to pay government taxes. We see from the beginning of the
                        film her distaste for her grandson as she terrifies him by wearing a clown mask and jumping out
                        at Happy when he is forced to move into her home after his father was killed and mother
                        estranged. We see Happy’s rage against his grandmother through his treatment of old people in
                        the film. Upon arrival at the old peoples home, Happy who was overwhelmed with joy as to
                        never deal with grandma again, decided to run over ‘crazy lady’, this was of course done by
                        Dugan to depict Happy’s scarred past of long-term abuse endured at the wrinkly old hands of
                        his Grandmother. <br><br>
                        The film takes a dark turn when Care home warden Hal [Stiller] forces Grandma into slave
                        labour at the care home, the director’s cut features long strenuous scenes where Stiller violently
                        rapes grandma and physically abuses many other of the care home characters at the home;
                        Phillis who was working in the sweatshop and complained that her ‘fingers hurt’ was heavily
                        beaten by Stiller who continued to drag her out the room. Sounds of rape and torture of Phillis
                        can be heard while grandma continues to knit harder as Phillis’s screams grow louder, with an
                        incredible and apparently improvised scene by Stiller, we see the Meet the Fockers actor roam
                        back into the sweatshop completely naked, dripping with sweat and blood, he then marches
                        over to grandma, tweaks his handlebar moustache, which is dripping with frothed saliva, and
                        calmly says “you want some of this? Do ya Grandma?”. The scene ends with applause from all
                        crew and cast. The film then progresses into a love affair between Grandma and Stiller where
                        Dugan questions the validity of a captive relationship, drawing inspiration from Nazi
                        Concentration camps and the SS officers who had relationships with their Jewish prisoners. By
                        the end of the film Happy [Sandler] is able to buy grandma’s house back after he signs a
                        lucrative deal with Subway after winning a golf tournament. However, when it came to the
                        editors table, producers wanted to see a more family friendly film, the rape scenes of Phillis and
                        Grandma were cut [arguably Stiller’s career performance] and a more heavy focus was put on
                        Sandler’s character Happy Gilmore and his golfing fast food franchise. However, many still
                        prefer the original gritty version where we see, at the end of the film, grandma die of syphilis in
                        her big useless house.<br><br>
