                        It’s late at night, you’ve just had a dinner, you’re looking through Instagram
                        and you see your mates all in relationships, you haven’t met anyone recently,
                        who you like, and you wonder why? You need a bit of affirmation in your life,
                        and you know where to find it. You go to the app store, and reluctantly punch
                        into your 4-inch keypad, ‘T-I-N-D-E-R’. 170 megabytes and 5 minutes later of
                        filling in your unimpressive personal information and filtered through your
                        best holiday pics – you’re live. It’s been 1 hour now; you’ve flicked through
                        more singles than you’ve met in the last 2 years, you’re thumb is aching with
                        rejection until you’re finally all out of ‘swipes’. The ‘swipe’ is the notion that
                        you could find your desirable other half through the flick of your index finger
                        or the tap of your thumb, romantic I know. After filtering through their beach
                        pics as well as the few ‘out out’ snaps with the ‘gals’ or ‘lads’, you think –
                        fuck me – I’ve found the one. Two wanks later and a glass of water you’ve
                        plucked up the courage to finally message them. Its awkward, you’ve never
                        met them, but their pictures and patter aren’t bad. Maybe you’ll meet up?
                        Actually, maybe not. Is this too weird? You don’t know but you haven’t had
                        sex in months and haven’t been in a relationship even longer, you go for it.
                        You arrange a date. They’re nothing like their pictures but their chat is above
                        average for someone who’s a complete stranger. After a few more drinks
                        you’re both pissed enough to courageously ask them to come back to yours,
                        or vice versa. After some fairly average sex and an awkward goodbye, as
                        well as a restless night sleep, you’re done. The ordeal is over, and you’ve
                        been able to satisfy your natural instinctual desire for a quick shag. You don’t
                        know if you’ll ever see them again, and you don’t really care.<br><br>
                        This, ladies and gents, is the sad reality of dating today. It’s hardly Romeo
                        and Juliette and its definitely nothing for Sting to scream about in his new
                        album, but it’s what we’ve got. But hold on, isn’t that exactly the problem?
                        Internet dating isn’t romantic or special, it’s not looking across the room of
                        crowded people and seeing someone you feel completely blown back by,
                        someone you feel compelled and excited at the possibility of speaking to. But
                        no. Online dating has reduced these beautiful and special moments to a 2D
                        image on your smart phone, encompassing no aspect of individuality, or even
                        a slither of personality or charisma which one may attain through meeting
                        someone in the flesh. Tinder is ruining and completely exploiting our desire
                        of what it is to first meet someone you may really fancy. I mean, who can
                        remember a time when you met a complete stranger who you immediately
                        felt a connection with? Butterflies in your stomach just at the possibility of
                        speaking to them, or the deep pain in your gut after being shot down? Ye, me
                        neither. this vital part of social human interaction has now become a thing of
                        the past. The organic, or ‘old fashioned’ way of meeting someone you really
                        fancy is gone. Love at first sight, is dead.<br><br>
                        Maybe this is why shows like First Dates and Married at First Site are
                        becoming increasingly popular in the UK, as it shows a true depiction of what
                        is [or isn’t] genuine excitement and spark at meeting a random person and
                        having to socialise with them, playing with your compatibility in a way which
                        is alien for most of the dating world today, hence making such good
                        television. However, this might be a greater issue of vulnerability and
                        insecurity of our generation, people are more afraid to put themselves out
                        there without seeing and judging little photos and making small talk before
                        ever thinking of physically introducing yourself. It also shows a deeper and
                        ever-growing need of our generation, affirmation.<br><br>
                        Today young people have become so obsessed with judgement and how we
                        look, we are constantly barraged with updates on our phones of ‘beautiful’
                        skinny models on yachts, or rich muscular men in sports cars, or that person
                        who is 2 years younger than you but is already a multi-millionaire with 4 cars
                        and 12 girlfriends. Making you feel; ugly, sad and worthless. This then drums
                        up huge demand for an app for you to find this affirmation that you so
                        hungrily desire. You stay single because you don’t really know how to
                        approach someone in an organic sense, you don’t even have much sex, but
                        you do have people interested in you, and that’s all that matters? Right?
                        Unfortunately. No. You’re still alone. When your phone runs out of charge and
                        ‘Don’ or ‘Tarquin’ is unable to message you, you feel lonely and bored. But
                        little did you know, you’ve been lonely and bored all along, the app is only
                        taking your mind off it and filling this fickle hole with pixels of artificially
                        created boyfriends that aren’t actually there, and most likely, never will be.
                        Hopefully after we’re allowed out of our houses, we will re-discover joyful
                        human interaction and delete these horrific and isolating apps which have
                        turned us into anti-social hermits. So finally we might be able to seek REAL
                        interactions with REAL people which will make us re-discover the sensation
                        of REAL relationships. But until then. Fuck love, I’ve got tinder.
