                        They smell, they’re racist, they’re in a constant state of confusion and they’re
long past it. No I’m not talking about the lead singer of the Smiths, I am of
course talking about, the elderly. These are the over 75’s, the proper ‘only
way is down from here’ types. These roaches who remember the BLITZ and
won’t stop banging on about how the corner shop is run by ‘one of those
muslamics’, they always forget your name and if they’re in your presence for
over a fucking second its stinks of some kind of shit wrapped in a mouldy
quilt of tears and lost dreams [the real smell of 80 years of rotting and
decay]. Now without satirical digs at my grandparents who were never able
to tell me and my brother apart, even after suggesting I, specifically me,
should have speech and personality therapy [WHO NEEDS THERAPY NOW
GRANDMA? – NOT YOU – YOU’RE DEAD. FUCK OFF].<br><br>
Yet it seems that the UK is desperately scrambling to preserve the lives of
the 80+ and with so many of them dying from a disease which has such a low
impact on the rest of society, only goes to beg the question... is it natural or
even desired to reach your 94thth birthday?<br><br>
Life expectancy in the UK now sits at 81 years old, just 30 years ago in 1990
this was 75, the same age that is the current life expectancy in Mexico.
Compare this to the average life expectancy of men in Glasgow, its 71 an age
at which most people dying of coronavirus are considerably above. Now,
Mexico has opened her borders and is no longer calling for the closure of
schools, universities, pubs restaurants and clubs. As you’re reading this
people our age are living it up in Cancun, no masks, no corona, no bother,
shagging on the beaches and suffering horrific comedowns [look at snap
maps Cancun its fucking ridiculous]. If people reach their 80’s or even 90’s
they should be applauded not artificially kept alive against their will with
pills and jabs.<br><br>

Scientists have now newly discovered that when you turn 78 your dick
actually folds in on itself, like some kind of sausage pancake. I mean, what
kind of quality of life is that? Even if you did manage to rush some ancient
blood to what now resembles an empty and used condom, your wife’s fucking
gross, if you pluck up the courage to rag the barren old hag you’d be going for
43 seconds max before your hips cave in. If I ever reach this age and my
children don’t buy me a one way ticket to Switzerland or even a little bit of
heroin to ease the pain of having to look and listen to my clapped up the arse
wife, I’ll beat them.<br><br>
As the government decides to lock us all up once again, making us grow
hatred for these retched old bags who we are legally obliged to protect,
meanwhile they’re sitting in their ivory towers [nursing homes], getting their
arses wiped, fed spoon to mouth, and even tucked into bed by fit young
nurses. At least their locked up with their chess playing, card game wielding
Benidorm watching old chums. We now find the whole country in a nursing
home, where we nurse those who aren’t sick or old or vulnerable.<br><br>
In reality, the UK has one of the highest death rates in the world not because
people were having pints without meals, nor was it because students went
back to Uni, and it wasn’t because of the mass protests of BLM. The abysmal
state of the UK has been caused by severe governmental failure from the
beginning of the outbreak until today. Aside from a decade of drastically
underfunding the NHS, the government has been unable to create safe
bubbles where people under the age of 65 can get on with their lives while
the most vulnerable in society can then be protected, an approach now
adopted by half the world. The 6th strongest economy with a less dense
population than Japan [which never had a lockdown] has been unable to

protect its own citizens. So, no Mr Handcock, it is not us young people who
are going to kill our grandparents. But make no mistake, after this is all over,
we will be coming for YOU.</strong><br><br><br></p>
