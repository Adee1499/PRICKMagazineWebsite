Our old and classical diners, eateries, markets and beloved greasy spoons are now an endangered species and are being taken over and turned into edgy watering holes for the mid-late 20’s alternative twats who have only been living in the area for a year while they build their careers as web designers and marketing agents. In London they call this tumour gentrification, but it’s happening all over the UK, and is turning into a much greater generational and cultural issue of individuality and arrogance than we might have initially thought. To understand this bizarre cultural and social phenomenon we must first look at how it has developed into the monstrosity that is it today.&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>Ten or twenty years ago food was food, you bought it, then you sat and ate it. Maybe you would go out to ‘fancy’ places on special occasions to spend a little bit more dosh and get a better service and a decent quality meal, your mum might ask the waiter to snap a pic of you lot on the disposable while you chowed down on some free scran, IDEAL. Yet this idea of ‘special’ has now been turned on its head as today young people and city ‘professionals’, and I’m sure much of us at home, beg to consider ourselves as ‘special’. This narcissistic cultural creature within us all has of course stemmed from our trusty enemy social media. People follow us, the more followers we get the more important and indeed ‘special’ we consider ourselves. Throughout the Teens (2010-2019) the social media boom took off with many crazes, which have today become norms, like the ‘food pics’ which originated with those special occasions. Where on your Nan’s 65th you and the family would go to that expensive place on the corner where you’d put on your freshly washed striped shirt and jeans and pretend like you belong in such a stuck-up establishment, where charging £9 for a glass of wine and £3.20 for a glass of coke for the kids is rather palatable, never mind the food. So, Fuck It! why not take a picture of this great meal? You’ll only get to enjoy a few times a year. This began to trend and was beneficial in two significant ways:</strong><br><br><strong>#1 Promotion for the restaurants and businesses:</strong><br><strong>The meals looked good and tasted good! Making them worth the price, the fact that they have been shared on social media backs this up and works as a significant review of satisfaction for the establishment, you can even tag the restaurant in your post and hashtag it, ‘#delicious!’ – drumming up more customers and advertisement for the business FREE OF CHARGE.</strong><br><strong>#2 Self-Promotion:&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Secondly, of course the self-promotion attained from eating at such a fine establishment, posting on your social media to make it look like you’re a regular at these expensive places, making you seem important and rich. You’re a cool dude and you want people to think that you can afford this meal, you also want to remind people how great your life is, and how shite theirs is in comparison; You’re eating an 12oz steak with hand-cut chips and a whisky crème sauce with an unpronounceable red wine, they’re on their sofa crying into their shreddies. YOU WIN!&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>However, this ‘special’ty has now turned into the mainstream, restaurants and cafes are upping the price and turning your meal into a self-fulfilling and pursuing prophecy. This is the belief that you are special and deserve to spend 3x the amount that you can afford on lunch and take pictures so everyone knows it. You’re therefore no longer paying for breakfast; for lunch or for a coffee, you’re paying for a slice of self-promotion. Fairly average meals are now pristinely arranged on wooden boards, or creatively slumped on a cleverly designed plate, or in a nice recyclable matte black coffee cup which is just perfect for you Instagram. Old greasys are now re-branding, calling themselves ‘Toast’ or ‘GUAP’, serving food that makes you seem, indie, cool and WOKE. But unfortunately, you’re now in your £615 a month flat share, staring solemnly into your instant noodles as you’ve spent all your weekly wages on your rent, a new seamless hat, and lunch at ‘GROSS’ (or something equally fucking pretentious) which leaves you with £2.37 that can be spent on the lesser important things in life. But at least you look good, and sophisticated, and SPECIAL on social media, to all your followers, of which you see around 10 regularly.&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>What I’m trying to say is that we aren’t special, and the desire for young people to seem special and interesting is taking over our lives and changing our surroundings, most of us don’t want to put these on our social media’s and don’t feel like we deserve such an expensive meal cos we haven’t got our heads shoved so far up our own arses we can’t even see our own overdrafts. So please, start going to your local greasys, support Sheila and Burts cafe (even if you feel a bit weird after their £3.25 full English), not the new flash and over-priced cafés replacing them. If you want to be special and creative, do some art lessons, paint a picture maybe learn French or Japanese? But one thing’s for sure, buying an expensive breakfast and snapping ‘cute pics’ of it doesn’t make you interesting. So, no I’m not paying £8 for a coffee and a fucking bacon sarnie (you cunt).</strong><br><br><br></p>
